  "lyrics": "When you were here before, \r\ncouldn't look you in the eye. \r\nYou're just like an angel,\r\nyour skin makes me cry. \r\nYou float like a feather,\r\nin a beautiful world \r\nYou're so fucking special,\r\nI wish I was special...\r\n\r\nBut I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.\r\nWhat the hell am I doing here?\r\nI don't belong here. \r\n\r\nI don't care if it hurts, \r\nI want to have control. \r\nI want a perfect body,\r\nI want a perfect soul.\r\nI want you to notice,\r\nwhen I'm not around. \r\nYou're so fucking special,\r\nI wish I was special.\r\n\r\nBut I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.\r\nWhat the hell am I doing here?\r\nI don't belong here\r\n\r\nShe's running out the door, \r\nshe's running, \r\nshe run, run, run, run, run.\r\n\r\nWhatever makes you happy,\r\nwhatever you want. \r\nYou're so fucking special,\r\nI wish I was special,\r\n\r\nbut I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.\r\nWhat the hell am I doing here?\r\nI don't belong here,\r\nI don't belong here.",
